# Ehlers-Danlos-Syndrome-EDS-_Video_Frame_datasets

This dataset has been meticulously curated from various hospitals and clinics that specialize in treating patients with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS). This condition, characterized by symptoms such as joint hyper-mobility and hyper-extensible skin, necessitates precise diagnostic measures. The dataset is a rich collection of high-resolution video recordings, which serve as a fundamental resource for developing advanced diagnostic tools using deep learning models.

Video Recording Specifications:
The video recordings were captured under clinical conditions using high-resolution equipment to ensure the clarity and precision required for medical assessments. Each video is shot at a resolution of 480 x 640 pixels and a frame rate of 1 frame per second. This setup allows for clear visualization of the stages of movement and stretching, making it easier to identify and analyze the clinical signs of EDS. Each video consists of 10 frames, providing a comprehensive temporal analysis of joint movements and skin extensibility.

Patient Demographics:
The dataset includes a diverse group of patients aged between 18 and 65 years. This age range ensures that the dataset covers a broad spectrum of adult patients who might exhibit varying degrees of EDS symptoms. Furthermore, the dataset includes a balanced representation of genders, with a gender distribution of 0.5±0.5, and a diverse range of ethnic backgrounds. This diversity is crucial for training models that can generalize well across different demographic groups.

Attributes of Hyper-Extensible Skin:
The hyper-extensible skin section of the dataset comprises 20 samples. These samples demonstrate varying degrees of skin stretchability, with skin stretch factors ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 times the normal length. The videos in this category focus on assessing the skin’s extensibility, providing clear visual evidence of the hyper-extensible characteristic typical of EDS.

Attributes of Joint Hyper-Mobility:
Similarly, the joint hyper-mobility section includes 20 samples, showcasing joint angles ranging from -30 degrees to 135 degrees. The joints assessed in these videos include the knees, elbows, wrists, and fifth fingers. This wide range of joint movements is essential for understanding the extent of hyper-mobility in EDS patients. Each video captures the joints in various stages of movement, providing valuable data for analyzing the flexibility and stability of these joints.

Combined Joint Movements:
Additionally, there are 10 samples depicting combined joint movements. These videos illustrate sequential arm movements, showing different stages of hyperextension categorized as Initial, Mild, Neutral, Moderate, Severe, and Extreme. This sequential representation is vital for analyzing the progression and severity of joint hyper-mobility over time, allowing for a detailed assessment of the condition.

Assessment Conditions:
The dataset also captures various assessment conditions, including uncomfortableness, functional impact, joint stability, and skin conditions. These factors are critical for a holistic evaluation of EDS, as they provide insights into the practical implications of the syndrome on patients' daily lives and overall well-being.
